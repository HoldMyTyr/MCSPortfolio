    <p>The Isle of Laeso May 2021</p>
    <p>This was the bigest project I have done so far, with over 16,237 lines of code created and 11,334 lines amended. I worked with three of my peers to make a Viking style board game inspired by Catan. In the game you can customize your character, collect resources, buid structures, and fight other players to win through three diffrent methods: kill, escape, or ascend. I was mainly in charge of chater creation, the Player class, setting class, setting files, as well as most of the logic in main, however I gave and recived some assistance from other members. </p>
